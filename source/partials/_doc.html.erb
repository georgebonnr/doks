  <h1>File Size Optimization</h1>

  <h2>Compressing CSS and JavaScript</h2>

  <p>
    Middleman handles CSS minification and Javascript
    compression so you don't have to worry about it. Most libraries ship minified
    and compressed versions of their files for users to deploy, but these files are
    unreadable or editable. Middleman allows you to keep the original, commented
    files in our project so you can easily read them and edit them if needed. Then,
    when you build the project, Middleman will handle all the optimization for you.
